# classic_models_mysql

This project involved building a database for Classic Models, using MySQL to load, model, and clean up data. 

We created fact and dimension tables, normalised the raw data, and got it ready for analysis of key business metrics, like sales, customers, and shipping times.

The project is part of the Unicorn bootcamp.
